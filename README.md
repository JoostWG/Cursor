# Cursor

Coming from a few years of discord.py, this is my first proper attempt at making a bot in discord.js.

## Installation

1. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Create config and fill it with your info
   ```
   cp ./example.config.json ./config.json
   ```
3. Create database file: `./database/database.db`
4. Migrate
   ```
   npm run migrate
   ```
5. Run bot
   ```
   npm start
   ```
